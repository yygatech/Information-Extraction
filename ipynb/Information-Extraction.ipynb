      "39 Late in the twelfth century he wrote a treatise upon measured music, the first one in all the history of the art, so far as we know, in which musical measure is treated independently of verse, and a notation given for representing it.\n",

      "46 One of the masters of this school, Hans Zeelandia, who died about 1370, is to be noticed on account of his part writing being more euphonious than that of his predecessors.\n",

      "50 The thirty-six parts here mentioned, however, were not fully written out.\n",
      "\n",

      "52 None of the compositions of Tinctor have been printed, and his importance in music history ranks mainly upon the theoretical works which he composed, and his relation as founder of the Naples school.\n",
      "\n",
      "53 Weary of waiting, Josquin composed a mass upon the subject la, sol, fa, re, mi, repeated over and over in mimicry of the oft repeated answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "54 Another anecdote of similar readiness is that of the motette which the king, who was a very bad singer, asked Josquin to write, with a part in it for the royal voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "55 Josquin composed a very elaborate motette, full of all sorts of canonic devices, and in the center of the score one part with the same note repeated over and over, the one good note of the king's voice--the inscription being \"_Vox regis_\" (\"voice of the king\").\n",
      "\n",
      "56 The mere fact of his having written motettes upon the genealogies in the first chapters of St. Matthew and St. Luke sufficiently defines the importance he attached to the words.\n",
      "\n",
      "57 One of the most beautiful of his pieces was a dirge written upon the death of Okeghem.\n",
      "\n",
      "58 In this position his services were required not alone as director of music in the church, but also as a servant of the republic, and it was his duty to compose or arrange music for all of the public festivals.\n",

      "59 This same composer is also credited with having composed a dramatic piece called _Orpheo_, which was performed with great splendor in the larger council chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "60 Again, in 1577, Zarlino was commissioned to compose a mass for the commemoration of the terrible plague which devastated Italy and carried off Titian, among other great men.\n",
      "\n",
      "61 Not content with having secular melodies employed as _canti fermi_ in the music sung to the words of the mass, the words of these secular songs themselves were often written in and sung by a majority of the singers in the choir, only those in the front rows singing the solemn words of the ecclesiastical office.\n",
      "\n",
      "62 At the same time Palestrina was desired to write a mass in a style suitable for the sacred office.\n",
      "\n",
      "63 Too modest to rest the case upon one work, he wrote three, which were performed with great care at the house of Cardinal Vitellozzi, and all were much admired, but the third, known as the mass \"_PapÃ¦ Marcelli_,\" in memory of the pope who had appointed Palestrina to one of his positions, was recognized as of transcendent excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "64 Palestrina continued to write masses, motettes and other works during the remainder of his life, but during the entire time lived in the extremely limited condition already mentioned, and was subject to much enmity from jealous singers and composers.\n",

      "65 Martin Luther (1483-1546) in arranging music for the Protestant Church, invented the chorale and added to the best melodies from the Plain Song some wonderfully fine ones of his own, such as \"_Eine Feste Burg_,\" and caused many others to be written by the best composers of the Netherlandish school.\n",

      "\n",
      "68 Besides this they had an entirely different set of characters for the same tones played upon the cithara, so that a word to be sung without accompaniment had one mark above it for the pitch of the note, while if accompanied even by the same tone upon the instrument, a second character was written for the instrumental part.\n",
      "\n",

      "200 His first opera, \"_La Caverne_,\" was produced in 1793, after which he wrote four others, as well as three which were never performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "201 Presently he secured a libretto, \"_La Dot de Suzette_,\" which was composed and performed at the OpÃ©ra Comique, with so much encouragement, that he soon after produced his one-act opera, \"_La Famille Suisse_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "202 A report of his performances of this kind being made to his teacher Matteis, he desired to hear them for himself, which he did with much surprise, and asked the boy whether he could write them down.\n",
      "\n",
      "203 The first composition of his was a sacred drama called \"_La Conversione di St. Guglielmo_,\" written while he was still a student.\n",
      "\n",
      "204 In the winter of this same year he wrote his comic intermezzo, \"_La Serva Padrona_,\" a sprightly operetta, which had a moderate success at the time, but afterward for nearly a hundred years was played in all parts of Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "205 He wrote several other operas, which had but moderate success, although many of them were performed with considerable applause after his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "206 By general consent the most beautiful work of Pergolesi was his \"_Stabat Mater_,\" which was written to order for a religious confraternity, for use on Good Friday, in place of a \"_Stabat_\" by Scarlatti, the price paid being ten ducats--about nine dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "207 It is for two voices, a soprano and contralto, and is excellently written.\n",
      "\n",
      "208 In 1770 Mozart wrote from Naples, \"The opera here is by Jomelli; it is beautiful, but the style is too elevated as well as too antique for the theater.\"\n",

      "209 Besides many operas he wrote a number of compositions for the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "210 In 1776 he was invited by the Empress Catharine to St. Petersburg, where he lived for eight years, and among other operas which he composed while there was \"_Il Barbiere di Siviglia_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "211 He was an extremely rapid worker, his librettist stating it as a fact that all the music of his successful opera of \"_Alsinda_\" was composed in seven days, although the composer was in ill health at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "212 Another of his best works, his \"_Giulietta e Romeo_,\" was composed in about eight days.\n",
      "\n",
      "213 It is said that this astonishing facility was acquired through the discipline of his teacher Speranza, who obliged his pupils to write the same composition many times over, with change of time and signature, but without any change in the fundamental ideas.\n",

      "214 While busily engaged as a popular opera composer, Zingarelli found time to compose much church music, his most important works being masses and cantatas.\n",
      "\n",
      "215 In 1675, when yet only seventeen years of age, Purcell composed an opera, \"Dido and Ãneas,\" which is grand opera in all respects, there being no spoken dialogue but recitative--the first work of the kind in English.\n",
      "\n",
      "216 After this he composed music to a large number of dramatic pieces, many anthems, held the position of master of the Chapel Royal, and in many ways occupied an honored and distinguished position.\n",
      "\n",
      "217 Nevertheless the style of playing and of writing for these instruments underwent a gradual change at the hands of these very masters, of such a character that when the pianoforte became generally recognized as superior to its predecessors, about the middle of the century, the compositions of Bach and Scarlatti were found well adapted to the newer and more powerful instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "218 In 1715 Scarlatti succeeded Baj as chapel master at St. Peter's in Rome, where he composed much church music.\n",
      "\n",
      "219 He wrote symphonies for the London Philharmonic Society, published very many sonatas for piano (about 100 in all), and in 1817 published his master work, a set of 100 studies for the piano, in all styles, the \"_Gradus ad Parnassum_,\" upon which to a considerable extent the entire modern art of piano playing depends.\n",

      "230 He was now free to devote himself to composition, and so thoroughly did he do this that in the year following, 1816, he experienced the novelty of having composed for money, a cantata of his having not only been performed upon the occasion of Salieri's fiftieth anniversary of life in Vienna, but money was sent him for it, 100 florins, Vienna money, about $20 American.\n",

      "252 At Darmstadt he wrote an oratorio \"God and Nature,\" which was performed by the _Singakademie_, of Berlin, in 1811; and an opera, \"_Alimelek_\" (\"The Two Caliphs\"), which also was successfully given at Munich in the Grand Opera House in the same year, 1811.\n",

      "257 They partake of the virtuoso spirit of the other great geniuses mentioned in a later chapter--all of whom wrote for the sake of an effect to be arrived at, rather than from any inner necessity of carrying out their tone-poems in such and such a way.\n",

      "258 He made a translation of Romeo's soliloquy, and began to compose music for it.\n",

      "264 So great has been the advance in musical taste since these were first composed, that \"The Ride of the Valkyries,\" a famous descriptive piece for orchestra, forming the prelude of the second act, has been played in all parts of the world, as also the \"Magic Fire Scene,\" which closes the opera.\n",
      "\n",
      "265 He wrote a most beautiful and noble letter to Wagner about it, and a little later he speaks of Hans von BÃ¼low having been with him, when he could not refrain from giving him \"a sight of Walhalla.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "266 He says that he felt it necessary to stop now and write a practical opera for the stage as it then was, in order to re-establish his connection with the German theater, for he did not believe that these works would be performed in his own time.\n",
      "\n",
      "267 Accordingly he wrote \"_Die Meistersinger_,\" and the opera of \"Tristan and Isolde.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "268 Although these operas were not successful at the time, \"_Die Meistersinger_\" has since become highly appreciated upon large stages, and it is in my opinion the most beautiful opera that has ever been written.\n",

      "269 The other work, \"Tristan and Isolde,\" is the most difficult opera that has ever been written, and will have to wait a generation yet, most likely, before its beauties are fully appreciated.\n",

      "270 After composing these two enormous works, Wagner went on to finish \"_Siegfried_,\" and then completed the work by writing \"_Die GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung_\" (\"The Twilight of the Gods\"), or, \"The Death of Siegfried,\" as he had originally intended to call it.\n",

      "275 In this strait he took to writing for the press, in the _Journal des DÃ©bats_, for which his talent was little, if any, less marked than for musical production upon the largest scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "276 In 1837 he composed his Requiem, for the funeral obsequies of General Damremont.\n",
      "\n",
      "277 The greatest of Berlioz's works is his splendid \"_Te Deum_,\" written during the years 1854 and 1855, for some kind of festival performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "278 Berlioz had no confidence in Wagner's \"endless melody,\" and when he writes about music he does so in the attitude of a humble follower of the old masters.\n",

      "279 The music of Beethoven and Schubert, composed during the first quarter of this century, and the influence of the virtuosi prominent during that time, whose activity has been told in connection with those of the century previous (the operative principles of which were the ones mainly influencing them); and the continual strife of the piano makers to increase the resonance, singing quality and artistic susceptibility of the tone and the strength and elasticity of the action, as recounted in the chapter devoted to the history of this, the greatest of modern instruments--were concentrating influences having the effect of calling attention to the new instrument in a very remarkable manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "280 He was the first to write piano pieces upon three staves, the middle one being devoted to the melody; a proceeding afterward followed in some cases by Liszt and Thalberg.\n",

      "\n",
      "284 His first appearance as a composer was in a set of variations on a waltz by Diabelli, the same for which Beethoven wrote the thirty-three variations, Opus 120.\n",
      "\n",
      "285 Whereupon Liszt wrote them to give themselves no further uneasiness, for he himself would be responsible for the entire amount, about $10,000.\n",

      "286 Concerning this memorable performance Berlioz himself writes: \"The piano concerto in E flat is generally known for one of the better productions of Beethoven.\n",

      "287 Liszt immediately afterward mounted the desk of the conductor to direct the performance of the symphony in C minor, which he made us hear as Beethoven wrote it, including the entire _scherzo_, without the abridgment, as we have so long been accustomed to hear at the Conservatory at Paris; and the finale, with the repeat indicated by Beethoven.\n",

      "289 As early as his twelfth year he began systematically to compose, and being naturally of methodical habits, which were still further encouraged by his father and mother, he kept an accurate record of his works, which at the last filled forty-four folio volumes, the most of the pieces being dated, and the place given where they were written.\n",

      "298 The first of his \"Songs without Words\" was published in 1830, having been originally composed for his sister Fanny.\n",
      "\n",
      "299 He had already written a number of those charming _capriccios_, in which the piano is treated with light staccato changing chords, such as Von Weber had suggested nearly twenty years earlier in his \"_Moment Capriccio_,\" but which no writer brought to such perfection as Mendelssohn.\n",
      "\n",
      "300 He also wrote a number of concertos for piano and orchestra, and one for violin, in which these two elements are very strong features.\n",

      "304 He writes under many pseudonyms, and has much to say about the \"David league against the Philistines,\" a society existing in his imagination only.\n",
      "\n",
      "305 It is not easy to ascertain the order of his compositions, since, as we have already seen, the sonatas and some of the other works appearing late in the list of opus numbers were composed very early.\n",
      "\n",
      "306 However this may be, the practice of writing gave Schumann a greater freedom, the effect of which is seen upon the next set of pieces, the six _Intermezzi_.\n",

      "309 The melody of the first strophe of this exquisite music might have been written for Church.\n",

      "310 He was without the technique of chorus construction, and writes injudiciously for voices in mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "311 In the symphony, for example, he writes badly for the violins, the very soul of the orchestra.\n",
      "\n",
      "312 He dreamed of the Schumann symphony all night, and at early morning went down to Breitkopf & HÃ¤rtel's to inquire whether this man Schumann had written anything for the piano.\n",

      "314 After a short course at the Conservatory of Verona, the boy commenced to compose, and no less than thirteen short pieces preceded his first really popular opera, \"_Tancredi_,\" which was produced at _La Fenice_, in Venice, in 1813.\n",

      "320 His first opera was produced in Vienna in 1818, but his first complete success was \"_Anna Bolena_,\" which was written for Milan in 1830, the principal parts having been taken by Pasta and Rubini.\n",
      "\n",
      "321 Like Rossini he was a writer of florid music, and \"_Lucia_\" remains one of the favorite numbers of _coloratura_ singers to the present day, which, considering that more than fifty years have intervened since it was composed, is a great compliment.\n",

      "\n",
      "325 But his first work, a comic opera which the managers demanded, \"_Un Giorno di Regno_,\" was a dead failure, and disgusted the composer to such a point that he declared that he would never write again.\n",

      "332 Gounod was born and educated at Paris, took the prize of Rome in 1837, after composing quite a number of works of a semi-religious character, in which direction he has always had a strong bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "333 He has also written an oratorio, \"The Redemption,\" produced at Birmingham in 1882, many numbers in which are truly imposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "334 His last opera, \"_Le Mort de Cleopatre_,\" was written during his long sickness, and on the whole was not a success.\n",
      "\n",
      "335 In addition to this he composed a number of operas, \"_Le Roi de Lahore_\" (1877), \"_Marie Madeleine_\" (1873), an oratorio, and \"Eve\" in 1875.\n",

      "336 He has also written a number of orchestral suites which have been very popular in all countries.\n",

      "337 Educated in the Conservatory, he composed his first symphony when he was sixteen, and was organist of the Church of St. Marri at the age of eighteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "338 He has also written several oratorios, of which \"The Deluge\" is the most important, and a large amount of chamber and pianoforte music.\n",
      "\n",
      "339 After his education at the Conservatory, and his service as accompanist at the Grand Opera, he received, in 1866, a commission to compose a ballet, \"_La Source_,\" in which he displayed such a wealth of melody and such fortunate rhythm that his talent was henceforth unmistakable.\n",
      "\n",
      "340 He has since composed a large number of ballets, many of which are known in all parts of the world, such as \"Sylvia\"; also a large number of songs.\n",
      "\n",
      "341 He has composed a large amount of orchestral music, a violin concerto in F (1874), \"_Symphonie Espagnole_\" (1875), for violin and orchestra, a rhapsody \"_Norvegienne_,\" and many other orchestral works, besides several operas, of which the \"_Roi d'Ys_\" (1888) is the most important.\n",
      "\n",
      "342 There was a sort of middle period in which he wrote several very witty works for the same stage, but the time of his greatest career dates from the production of \"_Mignon_\" (1866), \"_Hamlet_\" (1868), and \"_Francesca da Rimini_\" (1882).\n",

      "344 The awakening of musical art has been remarkable in all parts of the civilized world, and in many countries not previously distinguished in music composers have arisen who have embodied the rhythms and spirit of the national songs in their works, composed dramatic works upon national subjects, and so have created a national school of music.\n",

      "346 Dehn recognized his originality and encouraged him to write \"Russian\" music.\n",
      "\n",
      "347 In 1848 he found a friend and appreciative companion in the Princess Helene, and then he wrote several operas upon Russian subjects, of which two were published--\"Dimitri Donskoi\" and \"Toms der Narr.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "348 It was for this occasion that the Saint-SaÃ«ns second concerto was written.\n",
      "\n",
      "349 Besides a number of brilliant and highly sensational overtures, he composed six symphonies, of unexampled sonority, rich coloring and strange musical expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "350 Smetana wrote eight operas upon Bohemian subjects, with music in the Bohemian spirit; one best known is \"The Bartered Bride,\" which was the last composed.\n",
      "\n",
      "351 He also wrote about ten symphonies or symphonic poems, and a great variety of chamber music.\n",
      "\n",
      "352 The choral works of Dvorak were generally first written for English musical festivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "353 During his residence in America he promulgated the idea that an American school of music was to be created by developing the themes and rhythms of the negro melodies, and he wrote a symphony, \"From the New World,\" in order to illustrate his meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "354 He composed in many varieties of work, and in 1879 attained German recognition by playing his own piano concerto at the Gewandhaus in Leipsic.\n",

      "356 England was a liberal patron of all the leading German masters, from Haydn, who wrote twelve symphonies for the London Philharmonic, to Beethoven, whose ninth symphony was written for the same society; Mendelssohn, whose \"Elijah,\" was written for the Birmingham festival, and Wagner, who received handsome compensation for conducting a series of concerts in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "357 He wrote a number of cantatas for chorus and orchestra, oratorios, \"St. John the Baptist\" (1873), \"The Resurrection\" (1876), \"Joseph\" (1877), and other works of less importance.\n",
