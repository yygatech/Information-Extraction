      "\n",
      "2 Later than the Homeric rhapsodists, the Hesiodic poems were composed and sung similarly by wandering minstrels, who, although wandering, were not on that account lowly esteemed.\n",

      "\n",
      "38 Late in the twelfth century he wrote a treatise upon measured music, the first one in all the history of the art, so far as we know, in which musical measure is treated independently of verse, and a notation given for representing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "39 Our modern art of homophony is like that in having but a single melody at each moment of the piece; but it differs from the ancient in the important particular of a harmonic support for the melody tones composed of \"chords in key.\"\n",

      "45 One of the masters of this school, Hans Zeelandia, who died about 1370, is to be noticed on account of his part writing being more euphonious than that of his predecessors.\n",

      "46 Dufay is also credited with having written pure canonic imitations without descending to the level of the rota, with its endless phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "47 All the work of this school, extending over two centuries, was either exclusively vocal, or written with main consideration for the voice, the instrumental additions, if any, having never taken on a descriptive or colorative character.\n",

      "48 He is generally credited with having composed a motette in thirty-six parts having almost all the devices later known as augmentation, diminution, inversion, retrograde, crab, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "49 The thirty-six parts here mentioned, however, were not fully written out.\n",
      "\n",
      "50 Only six parts were written, the remainder being developed from these on the principle of a round, the successive choruses following each other at certain intervals, according to Latin directions printed with the music.\n",
      "\n",
      "51 None of the compositions of Tinctor have been printed, and his importance in music history ranks mainly upon the theoretical works which he composed, and his relation as founder of the Naples school.\n",
      "\n",
      "52 Weary of waiting, Josquin composed a mass upon the subject la, sol, fa, re, mi, repeated over and over in mimicry of the oft repeated answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "53 Another anecdote of similar readiness is that of the motette which the king, who was a very bad singer, asked Josquin to write, with a part in it for the royal voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "54 Josquin composed a very elaborate motette, full of all sorts of canonic devices, and in the center of the score one part with the same note repeated over and over, the one good note of the king's voice--the inscription being \"_Vox regis_\" (\"voice of the king\").\n",
      "\n",
      "55 The mere fact of his having written motettes upon the genealogies in the first chapters of St. Matthew and St. Luke sufficiently defines the importance he attached to the words.\n",
      "\n",
      "56 One of the most beautiful of his pieces was a dirge written upon the death of Okeghem.\n",
      "\n",
      "57 In this position his services were required not alone as director of music in the church, but also as a servant of the republic, and it was his duty to compose or arrange music for all of the public festivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "58 This same composer is also credited with having composed a dramatic piece called _Orpheo_, which was performed with great splendor in the larger council chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "59 Again, in 1577, Zarlino was commissioned to compose a mass for the commemoration of the terrible plague which devastated Italy and carried off Titian, among other great men.\n",
      "\n",
      "60 Not content with having secular melodies employed as _canti fermi_ in the music sung to the words of the mass, the words of these secular songs themselves were often written in and sung by a majority of the singers in the choir, only those in the front rows singing the solemn words of the ecclesiastical office.\n",
      "\n",
      "61 At the same time Palestrina was desired to write a mass in a style suitable for the sacred office.\n",
      "\n",
      "62 Too modest to rest the case upon one work, he wrote three, which were performed with great care at the house of Cardinal Vitellozzi, and all were much admired, but the third, known as the mass \"_Pap√¶ Marcelli_,\" in memory of the pope who had appointed Palestrina to one of his positions, was recognized as of transcendent excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "63 Palestrina continued to write masses, motettes and other works during the remainder of his life, but during the entire time lived in the extremely limited condition already mentioned, and was subject to much enmity from jealous singers and composers.\n",
      "\n",
      "64 Martin Luther (1483-1546) in arranging music for the Protestant Church, invented the chorale and added to the best melodies from the Plain Song some wonderfully fine ones of his own, such as \"_Eine Feste Burg_,\" and caused many others to be written by the best composers of the Netherlandish school.\n",
      "\n",
      "65 They are written for the voice.\n",

      "66 These characters were written above the words to which they applied, and they had additional marks for duration, especially in the later periods of Greek music.\n",
      "\n",
      "67 Besides this they had an entirely different set of characters for the same tones played upon the cithara, so that a word to be sung without accompaniment had one mark above it for the pitch of the note, while if accompanied even by the same tone upon the instrument, a second character was written for the instrumental part.\n",
      "\n",
      "68 The Romans had also a notation consisting of letters written above the words to which they applied; they made use of the first fifteen letters of the alphabet in the same manner as the Greeks, but we do not know whether they employed the same characters for the instruments and the voices, or had different ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "69 This notation came into use partly through ecclesiastical influence, and partly owing to its being easy to write, while at the same time it occupied little space upon the page.\n",
      "\n",
      "70 These marks were afterward written upon a four-line staff, and the note heads were derived from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "71 34, probably came into use about the same time as that when Hucbald's book was written, but it was not until the days of Guido of Arezzo that the staff was employed in anything like its modern form, nor is it certain that Guido had anything to do with introducing it.\n",

      "72 In one of the manuscripts of his book letters are written upon the lines and spaces, and in another the neumes are given.\n",
      "\n",
      "73 The term approximate is used above by reason of the fact that no sharps or flats were written until long after this period, but it is thought that they were occasionally interpolated by the singers quite a long time before it became customary to put them into the notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "74 The clef for do (C clef) remained in use until very lately, and is still used by many strict theorists, being written upon the first line for the soprano, the fourth line for the tenor, the third line for the alto.\n",
      "\n",
      "75 The G clef, also, when first introduced, was often written upon the third or the first line; the F clef, moreover, was not definitely established on the fourth line until toward 1700.\n",

      "76 In the scores of Palestrina's work, now published in complete form, there are pieces written with the soprano in the G clef upon the first line, the alto in the C clef upon the second line, the tenor in the C clef upon the fourth line, and the bass in the F clef upon the third line.\n",
      "\n",
      "77 The smaller rhythmic divisions of the measure were very little used in the old music which, if not sung in slow time, was at least written in long notes, and the smaller varieties of notes are the invention of a period perhaps rather later than that at which we have now arrived.\n",

      "83 The effect of a composition of this kind was no other than that of a succession of chords, and the ear was as thoroughly educated to chord perception by this class of music as if the composer had intended only to write successions of chords.\n",

      "113 It would take us too far were we to enumerate all the composers who distinguished themselves in this century, no one of them succeeding in composing anything satisfactory to this later generation, but all contributing something toward the liberation of instrumental music, and all adding something to its too limited resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "114 Buxtehude wrote a great number of pieces in free style for the organ, and, while his works have little value to modern ears, there is no doubt that this master was an important influence upon the enfranchisement of instrumental music.\n",

      "\n",
      "128 He wrote in a tasteful and free, but somewhat superficial, style; and while his compositions bear favorable comparison with those of other musicians of his time, they are by no means of a commanding nature like those of his father.\n",

      "131 He composed constantly, without having had the slightest regular training.\n",
      "\n",
      "132 He offered the passing advice, that the composer would have done better to have taken two voices, and that the best exercise for him would be to write \"divisions\" (variations) upon the airs he sang in the service--but no instruction.\n",

      "\n",
      "151 In this practical school of adversity the boy grew up, arranging continually, training the orchestra, adapting music and composing--for he began this very soon; in fact, we have certain sonatinas of his, composed while he was but ten years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "152 The _Adagio_ of this is especially interesting, not only because it shows a freedom and a pure lyric quality totally foreign to Emanuel Bach, and beyond Mozart even, but because it was taken out of a quartette which he had written when he was fifteen years old.\n",

      "\n",
      "154 Within two years from the \"_Sonata Pathetique_,\" he had composed all the sonatas up to the two numbered Opus 27, in which the so-called \"Moonlight\" stands second, and between these a variety of variations, and several important chamber pieces, not forgetting the oratorio, \"Christ on the Mount of Olives\"--a work which although not fully successful, nevertheless contained many beautiful ideas, and one chorus which must be ranked among the best which the repertory of oratorio can show--\"Hallelujah to the Father.\"\n",

      "155 Then in 1821 and 1822 the last of the sonatas, which carry this form of pianoforte writing to a point which it had never previously reached, if since; and then the \"_Messe Solennelle_,\" and the ninth symphony, the latter having been composed in 1822-1823.\n",

      "166 Mozart, also, while a beautiful player upon the pianoforte of his day, did not possess the prescience of Beethoven, who was able to see over the pianoforte of his time and write as if he felt the assurance of the nobler and yet nobler instruments of these later times.\n",

      "167 He was himself a great pianist, as we see in the concertos which he wrote, always intending to play them at some concert or other in near prospect.\n",
      "\n",
      "168 He deviated from the sonata form in every direction, and this not alone in his later works, when we might suppose he had become wearied with the repetition of his ideas in the same order, but in his works of middle life, when as yet he might apparently have gone on writing sonatas indefinitely, so fresh, so novel and so varied were the tone pictures which he gave the world under this name.\n",

      "\n",
      "171 Being dissatisfied with the music of his part (written by one Schurmann, a local director), he substituted other airs of his own composition, which were so popular that he was commissioned to write an opera, and was appointed assistant director.\n",
      "\n",
      "172 His first opera, \"_Polliodoro_,\" was successful, and he was commissioned to write five others, some in Italian, some in German.\n",

      "173 Besides these he composed several cantatas for church use, and several instrumental pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "174 Here, among other works, he composed fifty Italian cantatas, usually consisting of two airs with recitative.\n",
      "\n",
      "175 Here he composed no less than twenty-seven operas, the last being in 1756, all in the Italian style, in so far as a German might master it, and all making the singer the prime person of consideration, and the listener next.\n",
      "\n",
      "176 Here he wrote several operas, all more or less in the Italian style as he had been taught it, and as he heard it upon every hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "177 His first work, \"_Artaserse_,\" the book by Metastasio, was produced with such success in Milan, in 1741, that he presently wrote several others for other Italian theaters.\n",

      "178 The fame of Gluck had now extended to England, and in 1745 he was invited to London to compose operas for the Haymarket theater.\n",

      "180 The two operas produced in London made but a moderate success, and Gluck was commissioned to write a \"_pasticcio_\" or medley of styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "181 Upon reaching Vienna he wrote a number of instrumental pieces, bearing the name of symphonies, pieces which in no way differed from the conventional music of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "182 So Gluck went back to Italy, and there he wrote another opera, rather better in quality than his previous ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "183 At length in 1762 was produced his first master work, \"Orpheus and Eurydice,\" the libretto having been written by the imperial councillor Calzabigi.\n",
      "\n",
      "184 But in 1767 he returned to Calzabigi, and upon a libretto of his wrote \"_Alceste_\" which was produced at the Vienna opera house in 1767 with vastly more success than \"Orpheus.\"\n",

      "185 I have therefore refrained from interrupting the actor in the fervor of his dialogue by introducing the accustomed tedious _ritournelle_; nor have I broken his phrase at an opportune vowel that the flexibility of his voice might be exhibited in a lengthy flourish; nor have I written phrases for the orchestra to afford the singer opportunity to take a long breath preparatory to the accepted flourish; nor have I dared to hurry over the second part of an aria, when such contained the passion and the most important matter, to find myself in accord with the conventional repeat of the same phrase four times.\n",
      "\n",
      "186 There were several numbers in \"_Alceste_\" which exercised an influence upon subsequent composers, among the more notable being the speech of the oracle, which Mozart must have had in mind in writing the commandatore's reply to Don Giovanni; and the sacrificial march, which probably influenced the priests' march in the \"Magic Flute.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "194 In 1760 he produced his best, \"_Messe des Morts_,\" in which he made a sensation by writing the \"_Tuba Mirum_\" for two orchestras, one of wind instruments concealed outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "195 He wrote twelve operas which were successfully produced, twenty-six symphonies and a variety of other works.\n",

      "197 His first opera, \"_La Caverne_,\" was produced in 1793, after which he wrote four others, as well as three which were never performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "198 Presently he secured a libretto, \"_La Dot de Suzette_,\" which was composed and performed at the Op√©ra Comique, with so much encouragement, that he soon after produced his one-act opera, \"_La Famille Suisse_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "199 A report of his performances of this kind being made to his teacher Matteis, he desired to hear them for himself, which he did with much surprise, and asked the boy whether he could write them down.\n",

      "\n",
      "201 In the winter of this same year he wrote his comic intermezzo, \"_La Serva Padrona_,\" a sprightly operetta, which had a moderate success at the time, but afterward for nearly a hundred years was played in all parts of Europe.\n",

      "203 By general consent the most beautiful work of Pergolesi was his \"_Stabat Mater_,\" which was written to order for a religious confraternity, for use on Good Friday, in place of a \"_Stabat_\" by Scarlatti, the price paid being ten ducats--about nine dollars.\n",

      "\n",
      "214 Nevertheless the style of playing and of writing for these instruments underwent a gradual change at the hands of these very masters, of such a character that when the pianoforte became generally recognized as superior to its predecessors, about the middle of the century, the compositions of Bach and Scarlatti were found well adapted to the newer and more powerful instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "215 In 1715 Scarlatti succeeded Baj as chapel master at St. Peter's in Rome, where he composed much church music.\n",
      "\n",
      "216 He wrote symphonies for the London Philharmonic Society, published very many sonatas for piano (about 100 in all), and in 1817 published his master work, a set of 100 studies for the piano, in all styles, the \"_Gradus ad Parnassum_,\" upon which to a considerable extent the entire modern art of piano playing depends.\n",
      "\n",
      "217 It was there that Haydn met him, and wrote to Dussek's father in high terms of his son's talents and good qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "218 As a composer he wrote many things of more than average excellence, and some of his lighter compositions still have vitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "219 He wrote the words along the score and conducted the music wherever the spirit of the words took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "220 Soon after his arrival in Vienna, Spohr received a singular proposition from one Herr von Tost, to the effect \"that for a proportionate pecuniary consideration I would assign over to him all I might compose, or had already written, in Vienna, for the term of three years, to be his sole property during that time; to give him the original scores, and to keep myself even no copy of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "221 He says of the melody of the famous \"Hymn to Joy,\" in Beethoven's ninth symphony, that it is so \"monstrous and tasteless, and its grasp of Schiller's ode so trivial, that I cannot even now understand how a genius like Beethoven could have written it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "222 He writes freely and fantastically, in spite of his early training.\n",
      "\n",
      "223 Early he began to write, among his first works being certain pieces for the piano and violin, composed when he was a little more than eleven.\n",
      "\n",
      "224 The two boys became intimate, and one day the little fellow, blushing deeply, admitted to the older one that he had composed much, and would do so still more if he could get the music paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "225 He was now free to devote himself to composition, and so thoroughly did he do this that in the year following, 1816, he experienced the novelty of having composed for money, a cantata of his having not only been performed upon the occasion of Salieri's fiftieth anniversary of life in Vienna, but money was sent him for it, 100 florins, Vienna money, about $20 American.\n",
      "\n",
      "226 He was already composing operas, and in 1816 there was one, \"_Die Burgschaft_,\" in three acts.\n",
      "\n",
      "227 The rapidity with which he composed songs was incredible.\n",
      "\n",
      "228 Schubert took up the volume, turned a few pages, became interested in one of the pieces, took up some waste paper, and scribbling the lines proceeded to write a melody.\n",
      "\n",
      "229 The following year, among other compositions, was the oratorio of \"Lazarus,\" which was composed in three parts--first, the sickness and death, then the burial and elegy, and, finally, the resurrection.\n",
      "\n",
      "230 The last part, unfortunately, if ever written, has been lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "231 He was very industrious, usually rising soon after five in the morning, and, after a light breakfast of coffee and rolls, writing steadily about seven hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "232 Whole acts of operas were composed and beautifully written out in score within a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "233 Upon the same morning from three to six songs might be written, if the poems chanced to attract him.\n",
      "\n",
      "234 It is only a question of writing it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "235 He never wrote a good fugue, and his counterpoint was indifferent; but on the other hand he had several qualities which Mozart had not, and in particular a very curious and interesting mental phenomenon, which we might call psychical resonance or clairvoyance.\n",
      "\n",
      "236 In the Assyrian sculptures discovered by Layard, there are instruments apparently composed of metal rods or plates, touched by hammers, upon the same general principle as the toy instrument with glass plates, or the xylophone composed of wooden rods resting upon bands of straw.\n",
      "\n",
      "237 This was a trapeze-shaped instrument, composed of a solid frame, sounding board and metal wires struck with hammers.\n",
      "\n",
      "238 Two forms of instruments were at length developed, composed of a wire-strung psaltery, played from a chromatic keyboard like that of the organ.\n",
      "\n",
      "239 The father was an actor, and the director of a traveling troupe, largely composed of his own children by a former marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "240 At this time an opera book was given him, \"_Das Wald M√§dchen_,\" and the opera was composed and produced in November.\n",
      "\n",
      "241 He showed great talent for direction and organization, and here he composed his first serious opera \"_Rubezahl_\" (1806).\n",
      "\n",
      "242 After composing several short pieces, he led a somewhat irregular life for several years, concerting as a pianist, writing articles for the papers, at which he was very talented, beginning a musical novel, and at length, in 1810, producing his opera \"_Abou Hassan_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "243 In 1825 he composed \"_Oberon_,\" the first of the operas in which the fairy principle has prominent exemplification.\n",
      "\n",
      "244 These operas, with their beautifully descriptive music, in which voices and orchestra co-operate with the action and scene as one, were composed at the same time that the young Franz Schubert was improvising his beautiful songs in Vienna.\n",
      "\n",
      "245 At Darmstadt he wrote an oratorio \"God and Nature,\" which was performed by the _Singakademie_, of Berlin, in 1811; and an opera, \"_Alimelek_\" (\"The Two Caliphs\"), which also was successfully given at Munich in the Grand Opera House in the same year, 1811.\n",
      "\n",
      "246 He now returned to Berlin, but his opera, \"_Das Brandenburger Thor_,\" which he had written for Berlin, was not performed, owing to opposing intrigues.\n",
      "\n",
      "247 Here in 1842 he wrote his \"_Das Feldlager in Schlesien_\" in which Jenny Lind made a great success.\n",
      "\n",
      "248 Besides the operas above mentioned Meyerbeer wrote a quantity of other music for orchestra, cantatas, and occasional pieces for festival purposes, of which the \"Schiller March\" is an example.\n",
      "\n",
      "249 Whereupon Meyerbeer wrote the impassioned duet, since so celebrated, and which in fact is generally recognized as one of the most suitable, not to say most effective, incidents of the whole opera.\n",
      "\n",
      "250 They partake of the virtuoso spirit of the other great geniuses mentioned in a later chapter--all of whom wrote for the sake of an effect to be arrived at, rather than from any inner necessity of carrying out their tone-poems in such and such a way.\n",
      "\n",
      "251 He made a translation of Romeo's soliloquy, and began to compose music for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "252 He had then written one opera, called \"The Love Veto.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "253 He heard the legend of the Flying Dutchman, and the next year made a poem of it and commenced to write the opera.\n",
      "\n",
      "254 This opera he had written on a large scale in the hope of pleasing Meyerbeer, whose influence at Paris was very strong at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "255 He was reduced to great straits, and had to write _potpourri_ for the cornet and piano at a beggarly price, in order to gain a living.\n",
      "\n",
      "256 Soon after his removal to Zurich, he commenced to compose the libretto of the \"Nibelung's Ring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "257 So great has been the advance in musical taste since these were first composed, that \"The Ride of the Valkyries,\" a famous descriptive piece for orchestra, forming the prelude of the second act, has been played in all parts of the world, as also the \"Magic Fire Scene,\" which closes the opera.\n",
      "\n",
      "258 He wrote a most beautiful and noble letter to Wagner about it, and a little later he speaks of Hans von B√ºlow having been with him, when he could not refrain from giving him \"a sight of Walhalla.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "259 He says that he felt it necessary to stop now and write a practical opera for the stage as it then was, in order to re-establish his connection with the German theater, for he did not believe that these works would be performed in his own time.\n",
      "\n",
      "260 Accordingly he wrote \"_Die Meistersinger_,\" and the opera of \"Tristan and Isolde.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "261 Although these operas were not successful at the time, \"_Die Meistersinger_\" has since become highly appreciated upon large stages, and it is in my opinion the most beautiful opera that has ever been written.\n",
      "\n",
      "262 The other work, \"Tristan and Isolde,\" is the most difficult opera that has ever been written, and will have to wait a generation yet, most likely, before its beauties are fully appreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "263 After composing these two enormous works, Wagner went on to finish \"_Siegfried_,\" and then completed the work by writing \"_Die G√∂tterd√§mmerung_\" (\"The Twilight of the Gods\"), or, \"The Death of Siegfried,\" as he had originally intended to call it.\n",
      "\n",
      "264 The orchestra, likewise, in great part was to be composed of virtuosi--also to play without pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "265 The most important is his \"Opera and Drama,\" written in 1851.\n",
      "\n",
      "266 He is most at home with the grand, the gigantic, the superhuman; and in nearly all that he writes the primeval undertone of the minor makes itself felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "267 In this strait he took to writing for the press, in the _Journal des D√©bats_, for which his talent was little, if any, less marked than for musical production upon the largest scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "268 In 1837 he composed his Requiem, for the funeral obsequies of General Damremont.\n",
      "\n",
      "269 The greatest of Berlioz's works is his splendid \"_Te Deum_,\" written during the years 1854 and 1855, for some kind of festival performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "270 Berlioz had no confidence in Wagner's \"endless melody,\" and when he writes about music he does so in the attitude of a humble follower of the old masters.\n",
      "\n",
      "271 The music of Beethoven and Schubert, composed during the first quarter of this century, and the influence of the virtuosi prominent during that time, whose activity has been told in connection with those of the century previous (the operative principles of which were the ones mainly influencing them); and the continual strife of the piano makers to increase the resonance, singing quality and artistic susceptibility of the tone and the strength and elasticity of the action, as recounted in the chapter devoted to the history of this, the greatest of modern instruments--were concentrating influences having the effect of calling attention to the new instrument in a very remarkable manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "272 He was the first to write piano pieces upon three staves, the middle one being devoted to the melody; a proceeding afterward followed in some cases by Liszt and Thalberg.\n",
      "\n",
      "273 He early began to compose, and by the time he was thirteen or fourteen, had undertaken a number of works of considerable magnitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "274 When he started upon his tour to Vienna, he had with him certain manuscripts, which he had composed.\n",
      "\n",
      "275 His Opus 2 consisted of variations upon Mozart's air, \"_La ci Darem la Mano_,\" of which later Schumann wrote such a glowing account in his paper at Leipsic.\n",
      "\n",
      "276 His first appearance as a composer was in a set of variations on a waltz by Diabelli, the same for which Beethoven wrote the thirty-three variations, Opus 120.\n",
      "\n",
      "277 Whereupon Liszt wrote them to give themselves no further uneasiness, for he himself would be responsible for the entire amount, about $10,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "278 Concerning this memorable performance Berlioz himself writes: \"The piano concerto in E flat is generally known for one of the better productions of Beethoven.\n",
      "\n",
      "279 Liszt immediately afterward mounted the desk of the conductor to direct the performance of the symphony in C minor, which he made us hear as Beethoven wrote it, including the entire _scherzo_, without the abridgment, as we have so long been accustomed to hear at the Conservatory at Paris; and the finale, with the repeat indicated by Beethoven.\n",
      "\n",
      "280 He also wrote a number of large choral works, among them his \"Legend of the Holy Elizabeth,\" the \"Graner Mass,\" etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "281 As early as his twelfth year he began systematically to compose, and being naturally of methodical habits, which were still further encouraged by his father and mother, he kept an accurate record of his works, which at the last filled forty-four folio volumes, the most of the pieces being dated, and the place given where they were written.\n",
      "\n",
      "282 In the year 1820 he composed between fifty and sixty movements, of almost every sort, songs, part songs, pieces for organ, piano, strings and orchestra, as well as a cantata, and a little comedy for voices and a piano.\n",
      "\n",
      "283 In the summer of 1820, the whole family made a tour of Switzerland, and a very large number of pieces were composed at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "284 For occasions like this he wrote several small operas, and his talent was encouraged in every way by his parents, and by his very judicious teacher, the celebrated Zelter.\n",
      "\n",
      "285 His celebrated octette for strings, Opus 20, was composed in 1825.\n",
      "\n",
      "286 The year following he composed the overture to \"The Midsummer Night's Dream,\" one of the most remarkable pieces of the early romantic school.\n",
      "\n",
      "287 He had already written an opera \"_Camacho_,\" which had been submitted to Spontini, the musical director of Berlin, but it was never performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "288 His overture to \"The Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage\" was written in 1828.\n",
      "\n",
      "289 The first of his \"Songs without Words\" was published in 1830, having been originally composed for his sister Fanny.\n",
      "\n",
      "290 He had already written a number of those charming _capriccios_, in which the piano is treated with light staccato changing chords, such as Von Weber had suggested nearly twenty years earlier in his \"_Moment Capriccio_,\" but which no writer brought to such perfection as Mendelssohn.\n",
      "\n",
      "291 He also wrote a number of concertos for piano and orchestra, and one for violin, in which these two elements are very strong features.\n",
      "\n",
      "292 In the same year he went to Paris, where many of his works were performed and others were composed.\n",
      "\n",
      "293 He had already commenced to write songs, quite a number of which belong to the year 1830, when he was living in Heidelberg.\n",
      "\n",
      "294 At this time, 1833, he had written the first and third movements of the G minor sonata, had commenced the F minor sonata and completed the \"Toccata,\" which had been begun four years before.\n",
      "\n",
      "295 He writes under many pseudonyms, and has much to say about the \"David league against the Philistines,\" a society existing in his imagination only.\n",
      "\n",
      "296 It is not easy to ascertain the order of his compositions, since, as we have already seen, the sonatas and some of the other works appearing late in the list of opus numbers were composed very early.\n",
      "\n",
      "297 However this may be, the practice of writing gave Schumann a greater freedom, the effect of which is seen upon the next set of pieces, the six _Intermezzi_.\n",
      "\n",
      "298 \"The Carnival,\" a series of fanciful scenes, belongs to an earlier period, having been composed in 1834 and 1835.\n",
      "\n",
      "299 In this direction Schumann often composed at a later period of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "300 The melody of the first strophe of this exquisite music might have been written for Church.\n",
      "\n",
      "301 He was without the technique of chorus construction, and writes injudiciously for voices in mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "302 In the symphony, for example, he writes badly for the violins, the very soul of the orchestra.\n",
      "\n",
      "303 He dreamed of the Schumann symphony all night, and at early morning went down to Breitkopf & H√§rtel's to inquire whether this man Schumann had written anything for the piano.\n",
      "\n",
      "304 In 1803 he went to Paris, where he composed several operas with very poor success.\n",
      "\n",
      "305 After a short course at the Conservatory of Verona, the boy commenced to compose, and no less than thirteen short pieces preceded his first really popular opera, \"_Tancredi_,\" which was produced at _La Fenice_, in Venice, in 1813.\n",
      "\n",
      "306 He composed with the utmost facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "307 \"The Barber,\" one of the most successful operas ever performed, and the one of Rossini's works which bids fair to outlast the rest, was composed and mounted within a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "308 Rossini himself appeared upon the stage and sang the solos in a cantata which he had composed in honor of the King, George IV.\n",
      "\n",
      "309 This work, which is given in England as an oratorio, was a revised edition of his opera of \"Mose,\" which he had written for Naples five years before.\n",
      "\n",
      "310 Having now accumulated a fortune, he retired from the stage and lived the remainder of his life near Paris in elegant leisure, composing a solemn mass and a few other sacred works, but no other operas.\n",
      "\n",
      "311 His first opera was produced in Vienna in 1818, but his first complete success was \"_Anna Bolena_,\" which was written for Milan in 1830, the principal parts having been taken by Pasta and Rubini.\n",
      "\n",
      "312 Like Rossini he was a writer of florid music, and \"_Lucia_\" remains one of the favorite numbers of _coloratura_ singers to the present day, which, considering that more than fifty years have intervened since it was composed, is a great compliment.\n",
      "\n",
      "313 He was educated at Naples under Zingarelli, his first opera having been composed in 1826, while he was still a member of the Conservatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "314 His next work, \"_Il Pirata_,\" was written for _La Scala_ in Milan, the tenor part having been especially designed for the celebrated Rubini.\n",
      "\n",
      "315 It was this latter work which contains a brilliant duet for two basses, \"_Suona la Tromba_,\" of which Rossini wrote from Paris to a friend at Milan, \"It is unnecessary for me to write of the duet for two basses.\n",
      "\n",
      "316 But his first work, a comic opera which the managers demanded, \"_Un Giorno di Regno_,\" was a dead failure, and disgusted the composer to such a point that he declared that he would never write again.\n",
      "\n",
      "317 In addition to these works he has written a great \"Requiem Mass,\" and many smaller works.\n",
      "\n",
      "318 After composing two cantatas, which had a good success, his grand opera of \"_Mefistofele_\" was produced at Milan in 1868, and later in other leading cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "319 His principal works are the preceding, which was composed in 1856, \"_La Savojarda_\" (1861), \"_Roderico_\" (1864), \"_La Stella del Monte_\" (1867), \"_La Gioconda_,\" his master work, produced at _La Scala_, 1876, and \"_Marion Delorme_\" (1885).\n",
      "\n",
      "320 After composing several pieces, a little opera, a mass, etc., his first opera to be publicly performed was \"_Le S√©jour Militaire_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "321 During the fifteen years next following he wrote a succession of light operas for the smaller theaters of Paris, most of them with librettos by Scribe.\n",
      "\n",
      "322 After studying at the Conservatory and composing a number of operas which failed, or had but moderate success, he brought out \"_Zampa_,\" in 1831.\n",
      "\n",
      "323 Gounod was born and educated at Paris, took the prize of Rome in 1837, after composing quite a number of works of a semi-religious character, in which direction he has always had a strong bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "324 He has also written an oratorio, \"The Redemption,\" produced at Birmingham in 1882, many numbers in which are truly imposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "325 His last opera, \"_Le Mort de Cleopatre_,\" was written during his long sickness, and on the whole was not a success.\n",
      "\n",
      "326 In addition to this he composed a number of operas, \"_Le Roi de Lahore_\" (1877), \"_Marie Madeleine_\" (1873), an oratorio, and \"Eve\" in 1875.\n",
      "\n",
      "327 He has also written a number of orchestral suites which have been very popular in all countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "328 Educated in the Conservatory, he composed his first symphony when he was sixteen, and was organist of the Church of St. Marri at the age of eighteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "329 He has also written several oratorios, of which \"The Deluge\" is the most important, and a large amount of chamber and pianoforte music.\n",
      "\n",
      "330 After his education at the Conservatory, and his service as accompanist at the Grand Opera, he received, in 1866, a commission to compose a ballet, \"_La Source_,\" in which he displayed such a wealth of melody and such fortunate rhythm that his talent was henceforth unmistakable.\n",
      "\n",
      "331 He has since composed a large number of ballets, many of which are known in all parts of the world, such as \"Sylvia\"; also a large number of songs.\n",
      "\n",
      "332 He has composed a large amount of orchestral music, a violin concerto in F (1874), \"_Symphonie Espagnole_\" (1875), for violin and orchestra, a rhapsody \"_Norvegienne_,\" and many other orchestral works, besides several operas, of which the \"_Roi d'Ys_\" (1888) is the most important.\n",
      "\n",
      "333 There was a sort of middle period in which he wrote several very witty works for the same stage, but the time of his greatest career dates from the production of \"_Mignon_\" (1866), \"_Hamlet_\" (1868), and \"_Francesca da Rimini_\" (1882).\n",
      "\n",
      "334 Anton Bruckner (1824- ) a highly gifted organist and composer, has written seven symphonies, in which the style is very modern, and shows the influence of the theatrical style of Wagner.\n",
      "\n",
      "335 The awakening of musical art has been remarkable in all parts of the civilized world, and in many countries not previously distinguished in music composers have arisen who have embodied the rhythms and spirit of the national songs in their works, composed dramatic works upon national subjects, and so have created a national school of music.\n",

      "339 It was for this occasion that the Saint-Sa√´ns second concerto was written.\n",

      "\n",
      "344 During his residence in America he promulgated the idea that an American school of music was to be created by developing the themes and rhythms of the negro melodies, and he wrote a symphony, \"From the New World,\" in order to illustrate his meaning.\n",
